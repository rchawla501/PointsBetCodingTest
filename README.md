# PointsBetCodingTest
Project structure
- PointsBetCodingTest Solution
   - PointsBet.StringClassLibrary: Contains the original class StringFormattor.cs with modified code
   - PointsBet.Project: Contains Microsoft Tests
Notes:
String Join is simple and short syntax for string concatenations.
For small arrays we can use any of the above methods. String builder is meant to be high performant in large datasets. But both String.Join and StrinBuilder are at par for string concatenation in our case.
There are few test cases added in test project.
